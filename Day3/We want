We want to create the following manifests for our application: 

All the resources should have the label class=kube-basics


=> 1 secret

	Name: super-secret
	At least 3 keys (USER, PASSWORD, TOKEN)

=> 1 ConfigMap
	Name: super-cm
	At least 3 keys (index.html(multiline), ENVIRONMENT, config.txt)

=> 1 service type NodePort that targets our label (Leave the port attribution random)
	name: awesome-service 
	Expose 8888 redirect to 80

=> 1 Deployment
	Name: awesome-deployment
	10 Replicas
	Strategy RollingUpdate
		1 Surge
		2 unavailable
	1 EmptyDir volume (name: shared-empty-vol)
	2 containers: 
		- 1 busybox 
			Change entrypoint command by "while true;do date > /tmp/emptyvolume.html && sleep 1;done"
			Mount the secrets USER/PASSWORD as Env var -> USERNAME/PASSWD
			Mount the secret TOKEN as file in /tmp/token.txt
			1 volume emptyDir mounted in /tmp/emptyvolume.html
		- 1 nginx:1.17
			Mount CM index.html as Volume file in /usr/share/nginx/html
			Mount CM config.txt as Volume file in /home/.config
			Mount CM ENVIRONMENT as ENV var
			Use the same emptyDir volume mounted in /usr/share/nginx/html/volume/index.html
			Expose the port 80 of this container
			1 LivenessProbe
				-> HttpGet on /volume/index.html
				initial delay 20 s
				successThreshold 2
				every 6 seonds
			1 ReadinessProbe
				-> execCmd cat /home/.config
				initial delay 10 s
				failureThreshold 2
				every 10 seconds
	
	
=====================

=> 1 Cron job 
	Triggers every Minutes
	use a pod with a container that have an image busybox
	the job is to execute a wget on the service awesome-service:8888/volume/index.html
	6 completions
	2 in parallel
	FORBID concurrency policy
	Never restart on failure


================

Once this is done we want to perform a rolling update of our application 

Moving to use nginx 1.19 and using annotations 


Then finally perform an undo on the deployment to fallback
